        <p>There is nothing like a nice crispy sweet coconut shrimp! This recipe is so easy, and they cook quickly in the air fryer and they come out 
            nice and crispy. I love having a good steak, and making these to go along side. I love keeping a bag of shrimp in the freezer so I can whip
            these up on a whim. 
        </p>
        <p>Don't be shy to give these a try! Beginner cooks can create these fun appetizers, and really impress your company! </p>
